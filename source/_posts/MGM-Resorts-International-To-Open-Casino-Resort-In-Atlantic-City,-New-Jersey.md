The new casino resort will feature a 300-room hotel, a casino floor with 2,000 slots and 125 table games, several restaurants and bars, a spa, and a nightclub.

"We are excited to enter into this new market and bring our world-class hospitality and gaming experience to Atlantic City," said MGM CEO Jim Murren. "This resort is poised to help revitalize Atlantic City's gaming and tourism industry."

#  Gambling Fans Get Ready As MGM Announce Plans For Atlantic City Resort

Gambling fans have something to be excited about as MGM have just announced plans for a new resort in Atlantic City. The development, which is said to include a casino, hotel, and spa, is set to open in 2020 and is expected to attract plenty of visitors.

MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren made the announcement on Tuesday, revealing that the company had reached an agreement with AC Ocean Walk LLC to take over the former Revel Casino. The project is said to cost $2 billion, although an exact breakdown of costs has not yet been released.

According to Murren, the resort will be “a world-class destination” and will generate thousands of jobs both during construction and once it opens. He went on to say that the company was confident in the future of Atlantic City and that this latest investment would help to solidify its position as a leading tourist destination.

Atlantic City has seen better days, with a number of casinos closing down in recent years. However, things may be starting to turn around for the city, with several new projects in the works. In addition to MGM’s new resort, Hard Rock International are currently building a $2.4 billion casino resort and Philadelphia developer Bart Blatstein is planning a $500 million project that includes a casino, retail space, and apartments.

It seems that MGM are confident in Atlantic City’s potential too, with Murren stating that the company planned on being there “for the long run”. This latest investment may be just what Atlantic City needs to rejuvenate its gambling industry and bring in more tourists.

#  First Look: MGM's New Atlantic City Casino Resort

Atlantic City, NJ - MGM has finally opened the doors of its new casino resort in Atlantic City. The $1.4 billion property is the largest on the East Coast and offers guests a range of luxury accommodations, from standard hotel rooms to lavish suites with panoramic views of the ocean.

The casino floor is equally impressive, with over 150,000 square feet of gaming space featuring all of the latest slot machines and table games. There's also a huge variety of restaurants and bars, plus a huge entertainment complex that includes a spa, a fitness center, and a movie theater.

At face value, MGM's new Atlantic City casino resort seems like it's everything you could want in a casino destination. But how does it stack up against other resorts in Atlantic City? Let's take a closer look.

The first thing you'll notice about MGM's new Atlantic City casino resort is its sheer size. With over 2,500 guest rooms and suites, it's easily the largest hotel in Atlantic City. In comparison, Resorts Casino Hotel has just 1,471 rooms. This can be both good and bad - good because there's plenty of room to spread out, bad because some guests may find the property too large and impersonal.

The casino floor at MGM is also one of the largest in town. At 150,000 square feet, it's easily bigger than those at Caesars Atlantic City (118,000 square feet) and Bally's Atlantic City (86,000 square feet). This gives MGM an advantage when it comes to offering more gaming options - there's literally something for everyone here.

One big downside to MGM's new Atlantic City casino resort is its lack of exclusivity. Whereas properties like The Borgata or Harrah's Resort offer an "in-the-know" experience that rewards players who know where to go and what to do, MGM feels more like a mainstream resort. If you're looking for an "exclusive" experience that you can only find in Atlantic City, then MGM may not be for you.

All things considered, MGM's new Atlantic City casino resort is a major player in the market. It offers guests plenty of space to spread out and play some slots or hit the tables. Plus there are plenty of restaurants and places to enjoy nightlife on site. If you're looking for an all-inclusive resort destination in Atlantic City, then MGM should definitely be on your list
