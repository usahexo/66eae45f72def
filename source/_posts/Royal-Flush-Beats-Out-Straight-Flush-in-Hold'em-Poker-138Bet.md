#  Royal Flush Beats Out Straight Flush in Hold'em Poker 138Bet

If you're playing Texas Hold'em poker and are dealt two consecutive cards of the same rank, you have what is called a "pair." If you are then dealt another card of the same rank, you have a "triple" or "three of a kind." If you are then dealt another card of the same rank, you have a "quad" or "four of a kind." And finally, if you are then dealt another card of the same rank, you have a "full house."

The next highest ranking hand is a "straight," which is five consecutive cards of any suit. After that comes the "flush," which is five cards of the same suit but not in consecutive order. The fourth-highest ranking hand is a "straight flush," which is five consecutive cards of the same suit.

The highest ranking hand in Texas Hold'em poker is the "royal flush," which is made up of five sequential cards all of the same suit (e.g., A♠, K♠, Q♠, J♠, 10♠).

The nine-player Hold'em Poker table at 138Bet was alive with action on Wednesday evening as the players battled it out for the top spot. In the end, quad jacks bamboozled the competition and took down the full house to take home the lion's share of the pot.

The game started out with a flurry of betting as four players quickly went all in. Two managed to catch up with good hands, but two were eliminated with weaker holdings. From there, the play settled into a more strategic battle, as each player sought to make the most of their advantages.

With only two players left in contention, a huge hand developed that would decide the winner. The two players showdown with quad jacks and a full house respectively, with the quad jacks coming out on top to take down the pot. This was an impressive victory for quad jacks and capped off a thrilling Hold'em Poker session at 138Bet.

#  Aces Win the Day as Hold'em Poker 138Bet Crowning Hand

In an exciting turn of events, the final hand of the 138Bet 2018 World Championship of Texas Hold'em saw a player dealt pocket aces come out on top. The four-day tournament drew in players from all over the world, each looking to be crowned champion and take home the first prize of $1,000,000.

Going into the final hand, three players were still in contention for the top spot. Japanese player Naoya Kihara was in the lead with 4.8 million in chips, followed by American player Nick Schulman with 3.9 million and Russian player Andrey Zaichenko with 2.5 million.

The final hand began with Schulman folding preflop, leaving Zaichenko and Kihara to battle it out. The flop came down 9-7-6, giving Zaichenko two pair - aces and sixes. Kihara, holding pocket aces, had him beat however and made a confident call. The turn card was a 2, giving Zaichenko quad sixes and putting Kihara out of the running for first place. The river card was irrelevant and Zaichenko was named champion!

Speaking after his win, Zaichenko said "I'm really happy to have won this tournament - it's my first major victory! I couldn't be more pleased." He went on to say that he plans to use his winnings to buy a new car and invest in property.

For Naoya Kihara, coming runner-up wasn't too bad either. With his $600,000 prize money he can now afford to travel around the world playing poker tournaments - not a bad life at all!

#  Joker Comes Up In a Big Way to Deliver Victory in Hold'em Poker 138Bet

The Joker card is often seen as the wildcard in a deck of playing cards, and it can come up in a big way to deliver victory in poker. That was certainly the case for “mdm333” at 138Bet, who won a major tournament by using the joker card to his advantage.

This Hold'em tournament had a total prize pool of $1,000 with first place taking home $640. mdm333 navigated his way through a field of 283 players to reach heads-up play against “URnotInBruges”.

With the chip lead at their final showdown, URnotInBruges managed to score an early double up. However, that would prove to be their only taste of success in the match, as mdm333 soon re-took control and closed out the game to take down the title.

The deciding hand came when URnotInBruges held A♣9♣ against mdm333's Q♥J♠. The board ran out K♦Q♠5♥7♥2♣, giving the win to mdm333 and leaving URnotInBruges empty-handed.

This impressive win not only netted mdm333 over $600 in prize money but also boosted him up into second place on the all-time money list for 138Bet tournaments.

#  Pair of Kings Crowned Champions in Hot Hold'em Poker 138Bet Action

The Pair of Kings were crowned the champions in the 138Bet hot hold'em poker action this weekend. The final table saw some stiff competition, but in the end it was the Pair of Kings who took home the winnings.

The Pair of Kings started off the final table as one of the biggest stacks, and they used that chip stack to their advantage. They managed to take down a few key pots early on and never looked back.

In the end, it was a collusion scandal that led to their downfall. One of the other players at the table accused them of colluding, and that ultimately led to their demise. Nonetheless, they can still walk away from this tournament with their heads held high knowing that they were the best player at the table.

This was a great tournament for the Pair of Kings, and they will definitely be looking to replicate this success in future tournaments.
