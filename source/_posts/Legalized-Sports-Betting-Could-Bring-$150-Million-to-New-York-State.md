#  Legalized Sports Betting Could Bring $150 Million to New York State

A recent study by Econsult Solutions projects that legalized sports betting in New York State could bring in $150 million in annual revenue.

The study also found that if sports betting were made available at off-track betting (OTB) parlors, it would account for 95% of the total market volume. However, if online and mobile betting were also legalized, it is projected that this segment would grow to account for 58% of the market.

This potential new stream of revenue is something that New York lawmakers are taking into account as they debate legalizing sports betting in the state. The challenge is that there are already many competing interests vying for a slice of the pie, including casino operators, racetracks, and others.

Proponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it would be a win-win situation for the state. It would provide an additional source of revenue, while also helping to keep people engaged with sporting events. And since New York already has a thriving gambling industry, it already has the infrastructure in place to handle any increased demand.

 Opponents of legalizing sports betting are primarily concerned about its impact on addiction and crime rates. They worry that it could lead to more gambling addiction and problems with debt. And they question whether or not the state really needs another form of legal gambling.

So far there is no consensus among state lawmakers on how to proceed with legalizing sports betting. But with pressure mounting to find new sources of revenue, it’s likely only a matter of time before a decision is made.

#  NJ Sports Betting Revenue Could Reach $681 Million Annually

 _New Jersey gambling operators could generate up to $681 million in annual revenue from sports betting, a new study suggests._

The report, conducted by the Econsult Solutions research firm on behalf of the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement, considered various scenarios for implementing legalized sports betting in New Jersey. The finding is that New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks could generate a combined $611 million to $681 million per year in sports betting revenue.

Casino industry officials were quick to praise the findings. “This report confirms what we have long believed: Sports betting is a major opportunity for New Jersey’s casino industry and will create new jobs and generate much-needed tax revenue,” said Tony Rodio, president of Tropicana Entertainment and chairman of the Casino Association of New Jersey.

While the Division of Gaming Enforcement has not released an official statement on the report, it’s clear that its findings will be taken into serious consideration as lawmakers continue to debate the legalization of sports betting in New Jersey. A vote on a bill that would legalize sports betting is expected before the end of the year.

The news comes as neighboring states are also moving closer to legalizing sports betting. Delaware began taking bets last week and New York is considering a proposal that would allow wagers at Upstate casinos.

#  Report: Legalized sports betting would bring in $1.5B to Illinois each year

A recent study found that legalizing sports betting in Illinois would bring in an estimated $1.5B in annual revenue. This would make Illinois the top state in the nation for sports betting revenue.

The study, conducted by the gaming research company Eilers and Krejcik Gaming, found that if sports betting were legalized in Illinois, it would generate an estimated $1.5B annually in revenue. This would make Illinois the top state in the nation for sports betting revenue, far outpacing Nevada, which currently generates the most revenue from sports betting.

Revenue from sports betting would be used to support important causes in Illinois, including education and infrastructure improvements. In addition, the creation of new jobs would be another benefit of legalizing sports betting.

Sports gambling is currently illegal in most states, but there is a growing movement to legalize it. The Supreme Court recently struck down a federal ban on sports betting, opening the door for states to pass their own laws legalizing it.

There are many benefits to legalizing sports betting. Not only would it generate significant revenue for states, but it would also create jobs and support important causes. It is time for Illinois to legalize sports betting and take advantage of this lucrative opportunity.

#  How Much Revenue Can Legalized Sports Betting Bring In?

The sports betting industry is a massive one, generating billions of dollars in revenue each year. With the legalization of sports betting in the United States, this number can only grow larger. So, just how much revenue can legalized sports betting bring in?

To answer this question, it’s important to understand how the sports betting industry currently functions. Currently, most sports betting takes place illegally. This means that the total amount of revenue generated by sports betting is difficult to estimate. However, according to a study by Oxford Economics, the legal US sports betting market could be worth as much as $6.03 billion per year.

There are a few reasons for this large potential market size. First, there is already a large demand for legal sports betting. According to a survey by The Action Network, 78 percent of Americans support legalizing sports betting. Additionally, many people are already engaging in illegal sports betting. A study by Fitch Ratings estimates that around $150 billion is illegally wagered on sporting events each year.

If legalized, sports betting would likely cannibalize some of this illegal market. However, there is still plenty of room for growth. In fact, many experts believe that the legalization of sports betting could actually lead to an increase in overall gambling spending. This increased spending would create even more revenue for the sports betting industry.

So, what does all this mean for potential earnings? Well, if the $6.03 billion estimate is accurate, then the legalized sport betting industry could generate over $900 million in tax revenue each year. This would be a major win for government coffers and help to offset some of the costs associated with legalizing sports gambling.

Of course, it’s important to note that this estimate is just that – an estimate. The actual amount of revenue generated by legalized sports betting will depend on a variety of factors including interest rates and consumer behavior. However, there is no doubt that the potential for growth is there and that legalized sports gambling could provide a significant boost to government coffers

#  Sports Bettors Could Bring in Billions for States If Gambling is Legalized

While the debate of legalizing gambling rages on, there is one thing that is certain: If it is legalized, states will bring in billions of dollars.

The American Gambling Association (AGA) released a report in 2017 that studied the economic impact of legalized gambling. The study found that if gambling was legalized in all 50 states, it would generate $8.7 billion in taxes and create over 111,000 jobs.

This number could be much higher if other forms of gambling, such as online casino games and lottery, are included in the legalization. In fact, Forbes contributor Adam Sharp recently wrote an article arguing that legalizing all types of gambling could generate up to $132 billion in new revenue for states.

This type of revenue could be a lifesaver for cash-strapped states. In recent years, many states have been forced to make significant cuts to their education and healthcare systems due to budget deficits. legalizing gambling could help alleviate some of these problems.

There are also other benefits to legalizing gambling. It could help boost tourism in states that legalize it. People who visit casinos and other gambling establishments often spend money on food, hotels, and other things, which helps the local economy.

Legalizing gambling is not without its risks, however. There is always a chance that people will get addicted to gambling and end up losing more money than they can afford. There is also the potential for fraud and other criminal activity to increase if gambling is legalized.

Despite these risks, the potential benefits of legalizing gambling are too great for states to ignore. If done correctly, it could be a major boon for state economies across the country
