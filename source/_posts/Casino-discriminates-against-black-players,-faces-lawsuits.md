#  Casino discriminates against black players, faces lawsuits

Two black men have filed a lawsuit against a casino in Louisiana, claiming that they were discriminated against because of their race.

The two men, both from New Orleans, say that they were playing slots at the casino when they were asked to leave. They were later told by security staff that the casino has a policy of not allowing black people to play slots.

The men’s attorney says that this is clear discrimination and that his clients are seeking an undisclosed amount in damages.

This is not the first time that a casino has been accused of discriminating against black players. In 2017, a group of black gamblers sued a casino in Mississippi, claiming that they were banned from playing blackjack and other games.

Casinos have long been known for implementing discriminatory policies against black people. This is often done through the use of vague rules, such as “ dress codes” or “behavioral standards”, which can be used to unfairly target black customers.

Studies have shown that black people are significantly more likely to be arrested or kicked out of casinos than white people are. This is likely because casinos often rely on security staff who are biased against black people and are more likely to assume that they are up to no good.

#  Casino fined for refusing to let woman play poker

The owner of a casino in the German city of Dortmund has been fined 10,000 euros for refusing to let a woman play poker, according to a report from Deutsche Welle.

The Frauen-Bundesliga, Germany's top women's soccer league, had rented the casino for a fundraiser, but the owner refused to let one of the women players participate. The league took legal action and won the case.

"We see this as an important signal that we can enforce our rights," said Sylvia Schenk, who is on the board of directors for the Frauen-Bundesliga and also works as a sports lawyer. "It's clear that we're not going to stand for any form of discrimination."

This isn't the first time that casinos have been in the news for discriminating against women. In December 2017, an Ontario court ruled that Casino Rama Resort discriminated against female employees by paying them less than their male counterparts.

#  Class-action lawsuit filed against casino for discriminating against Hispanics

A class-action lawsuit has been filed against a casino in Nevada, accusing it of discriminating against Hispanic visitors.

The lawsuit, filed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), alleges that the casino operated a “racialized policy” which led to Hispanic customers being unfairly targeted for security checks and being subjected to surveillance by security officers.

MALDEF is seeking an injunction to prohibit the casino from continuing its discriminatory practices, as well as damages for those who have been affected.

“Casinos are not above the law, and must not be permitted to engage in such blatant discrimination against Latino visitors,” said Thomas A. Saenz, MALDEF president and general counsel.

The casino has denied the allegations, stating that it does not discriminate against any group of people.

#  Casino sued for discriminating against Asian-American poker players

A group of Asian-American poker players has filed a lawsuit against a casino in Las Vegas, alleging that the casino discriminates against them. The plaintiffs claim that the casino refused to let them play in its poker room, and that this amounted to discrimination on the basis of race.

The plaintiffs are seeking damages from the casino, as well as an injunction ordering it to stop discriminating against Asian-Americans. They also want the casino to be required to adopt anti-discrimination measures, and to provide training on anti-discrimination laws for its employees.

In a statement, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs said: "This is an issue of fundamental fairness. Casino operators should not be allowed to exclude Asian-American players from their poker rooms simply because of their race."

The casino has not yet commented on the lawsuit.

#  Casino fined for racism after banning Native American from playing

The Pechanga Resort and Casino in California has been fined $25,000 for refusing entry to a Native American man, citing his race as the reason. The incident occurred in February of this year, when security guards refused entry to the man on the grounds that the casino was "too busy" for him.

This is not the first time that the Pechanga Resort and Casino has been accused of racism; in 2016, two African American women claimed that they were denied service at the casino's buffet restaurant. The resort has denied all allegations of racism.

The Department of Justice issued a statement on the matter, saying that "All persons are entitled to be treated with equal respect and dignity, and to receive services free from unlawful discrimination." The DOJ added that it is committed to enforcing anti-discrimination laws "to ensure that all individuals are able to participate equally in our economy."

Racism is still a problem throughout America, even in 2018. This fine is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to combat discrimination and racism in all forms.
