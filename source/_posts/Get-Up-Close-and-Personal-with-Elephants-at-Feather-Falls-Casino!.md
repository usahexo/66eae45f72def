#  Get Up Close and Personal with Elephants at Feather Falls Casino!

The casino and hotel are known for their world-class gaming and e xciting entertainment, but they're also home to one of the largest herds of elephants in North America. The elephants can be seen at the property's 1,000-acre wildlife park, and visitors can get up close and personal with them during encounters.

There are three different ways guests can interact with the elephants: elephant encounters, elephant walks, and elephant baths. Elephant encounters allow guests to feed and pet the elephants, while elephant walks give guests the opportunity to walk alongside the animals as they roam around the park. Elephant baths let guests get into the water with the elephants and give them a bath.

The park is open every day from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and encounters cost $50 per person. Walks are $75 per person, and baths are $125 per person. There is also a $10 parking fee for cars and a $5 parking fee for buses.

If you are an elephant lover, there is no better destination to visit than the Elephant Scratch game farm in Somanya, Ghana.

You can enjoy the sounds of the elephants rustling through the bushes and trees right outside your window! 

The Elephant Scratch game farm was created in 2009 as a safe haven for elephants that had been orphaned or abandoned. The staff at the farm work tirelessly to ensure that these animals receive the best care possible, and they have become a vital part of the elephant conservation effort in Ghana. In addition to providing a home for these animals, the farm also offers educational tours for visitors.
