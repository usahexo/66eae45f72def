#  Learn from Benicio Del Toro: How to Play Blackjack Like the Dealer and Win Every Time!

Known for his roles in films such as The Usual Suspects, Traffic, and Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi, Benicio Del Toro is a highly successful actor. What you may not know is that he is also a blackjack dealer!

Del Toro has been dealing blackjack since he was a teenager, and has mastered the art of winning every time. In this article, we will learn from him how to play blackjack like the dealer and beat the house edge.

First and foremost, it is important to understand the basic rules of blackjack. The object of the game is to draw cards totalling 21 or less, without going over. The player beats the dealer if their total is higher than the dealer’s total, but loses if it is lower.

As the dealer, Del Toro follows a specific set of rules that allow him to win every time. Firstly, he always stands on 17 or higher. This means that he will not take any more cards in order to try and improve his hand. By standing on 17 or higher, the dealer cuts down on his chances of going bust (going over 21), which increases his chances of winning.

Secondly, Del Toro always splits pairs of 8s and Aces. Splitting pairs allows you to double your odds of winning by playing two separate hands instead of one. When you split 8s, for example, you are essentially playing two separate hands against the dealer with each hand having a 50/50 chance of winning.

Lastly, Del Toro often uses basic strategy to make decisions about when to hit or stand. Basic strategy takes into account the probabilities associated with different card combinations, and helps players make the most mathematically sound decisions possible.
