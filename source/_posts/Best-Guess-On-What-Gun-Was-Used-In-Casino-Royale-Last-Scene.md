#  Best Guess On What Gun Was Used In Casino Royale Last Scene

In the final scene of Casino Royale, Bond ( Daniel Craig ) confronts Vesper Lynd ( Eva Green ) on a train and shoots her after a heated argument. It has long been a topic of debate which gun was used in the scene, with various theories abound. In this article, we will take a look at the most popular theories and try to come to a best guess on what gun was actually used.

Theories on the gun vary from simple speculation to more complex arguments supported by evidence. The most popular theory is that Bond shot Vesper with his Walther PPK handgun. This is based on the assumption that Bond always uses his PPK in close-range encounters. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and it seems more likely that he would use whatever weapon is available to him in such a situation.

Another possibility is that Bond used his knife to kill Vesper. This theory is based on the fact that we never see Bond take out his gun in the scene, and he could have easily killed her with the knife he had been carrying. However, there doesn’t seem to be much reason for him to use a knife instead of his gun, and it’s unlikely that he would have had time to pull out his knife and kill her before she fled.

A third possibility is that Bond used another weapon to kill Vesper. This could be anything from a firearm to a non-firearm object like a rock or piece of wood. There is no clear evidence pointing to any specific weapon, so it’s difficult to say for sure which one was used.

So what is the best guess on what gun was used in Casino Royale last scene? It’s hard to say for sure, but it seems most likely that Bond used his Walther P99 handgun rather than his PPK. This is based on the fact that the P99 is a more versatile weapon than the PPK, and it seems more likely that Bond would want to use the most powerful weapon available to him in such a situation.

#  James Bond Fans Clamor Over Which Gun Was Used In Casino Royale Last Scene

Casino Royale, the 21st movie in the James Bond Franchise released in 2006 and starring Daniel Craig, recently made headlines when a still from the last scene of the movie surfaced on the internet. In the scene, Bond can be seen holding a gun that appears to be very different from the traditional Walther PPKs carried by 007 over the years. 

This has created quite a stir among Bond fans, with some insisting that this proves that the Bond movies are not all filmed in continuity and that various different actors have played 007 over the years. Others have claimed that it is simply a newer model of the Walther PPK or even a Beretta 92FS being used in place of the traditional PPK. 

The gun in question is actually an Heckler and Koch P30L, which was first introduced in 2006. This would make sense as Casino Royale was released in 2006 and it is unlikely that they would use an older model gun in a new movie. The P30L is very similar to the Walther PPK but is chambered in 9mm instead of .380 ACP. It also has a longer barrel and slide than the Walther PPK. 

While it is not clear whether or not this is actually the gun used in Casino Royale, it is clear that there is some controversy among Bond fans over what weapon was used in the last scene of the movie.

#  No One Knows What Gun Was Used In Casino Royale Last Scene

In the controversial last scene of Casino Royale - where Bond walks into a building and apparently shoots a man - the gun used is still unknown. Many debate on what kind of gun was used, with no clear consensus.

Theories range from it being a Smith & Wesson M&P Shield to a Glock 17 or a Browning Hi-Power. However, without confirmation from official sources, it remains a mystery.

One possible clue is that Daniel Craig, who plays James Bond, reportedly requested that Beretta provide him with a specific type of 9mm handgun for use in the movie. This has led some to believe that he used a Beretta 92FS Inox in the scene.

However, this cannot be confirmed, and the gun used in Casino Royale's last scene remains a mystery.

In the last scene of Casino Royale, Bond walks into an apartment holding a gun. audiences around the world were dying to know what kind of gun Bond was using. Many speculated that he was using a Heckler and Koch MP5, but that has since been debunked.

The gun Bond was using was likely a Walther PPK/S. This gun is very similar to the Walther PPK that Bond has been using for decades, but it has a few key differences. The PPK/S has a longer barrel, which gives it more accuracy and power. It also has an adjustable rear sight, which allows the shooter to adjust for wind and distance.

The Walther PPK/S is a popular choice for both law enforcement and civilians. It is lightweight and easy to use, making it a good choice for someone who is looking for a compact handgun. It also has a relatively low recoil, making it easier to shoot accurately.
