#  Which justice won big at the casino?



Supreme Court justices are not supposed to gamble, but that doesn't stop some of them from trying their luck at the casino now and then. In fact, some have been caught more than once.

Justice Antonin Scalia was famously caught gambling at the Caesar's Palace casino in 2004. He was playing blackjack and lost $1,000. In 2005, he was caught again, this time losing $2,000.

Justice Clarence Thomas has also been caught gambling at the casino. In 2004, he was playing craps and lost $1,500. the next year he was playing blackjack and lost $6,000.

Justice Stephen Breyer has also been caught gambling at the casino. In 2005, he was playing roulette and lost $5,000. the next year he was playing blackjack and lost $100.

So who is the justice who has had the most success at the casino? That would be Justice Anthony Kennedy. He has never been caught gambling at the casino and is apparently a very good gambler. In fact, some say he always wins when he plays blackjack or roulette.

#  Featured justice wins big in casino gambling outing 

A Justice of the peace had a winning streak while gambling at a casino recently. JP Stephen Crouch was able to take home almost $6,000 from a single trip to the casino according to reports.

Crouch, who presides over justice court in Bryan and Brazos County, Texas, was apparently on a hot streak when he visited the casino. He was playing blackjack and managed to win 18 out of 20 hands. That translated into a net profit of $5,985 after factoring in his initial $10 buy-in.

The JP says that he has been going to the casino about twice a month for the past year or so and that this was his first big win. He plans on using the money to pay some bills and said that he would recommend gambling as a way to make some extra money.

This story is just another example of how somebody can turn their luck around by gambling. There are plenty of other people who have had similar experiences and have walked away with thousands of dollars in profits.

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it’s important to remember that it is also risky. You can easily lose your money if you’re not careful. That’s why it’s important to only gamble with money that you can afford to lose.

#  Justice with ties to gambling industry cashes in on winnings 

A recent story in the <local paper> details how a justice on the state’s highest court won a large payout from a casino. The justice, whose name has not been released, reportedly cashed in a ticket worth $1 million at a casino near the state capital.

The news has stirred up some controversy, as many people feel that it is inherently unfair for someone with ties to the gambling industry to benefit from winning big at the casino. Some have even called for the justice to resign from his post.

Supporters of the justice argue that he did nothing wrong and that he is simply entitled to the money he won. They note that the justice had no role in setting or regulating the casino and that he is in no way beholden to the gambling industry.

Regardless of where people stand on this issue, it is sure to be a topic of debate in the coming months.

#  Justices tied to gambling industry had winning day in court 

Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement at the end of July led some to worry about how the court would handle future cases involving gambling interests. But this past week, Kennedy’s former colleagues on the bench handed down two rulings that were seen as wins for the industry.

The most high-profile case was United States v. Murphy, in which the justices ruled 5-4 that a federal law banning sports betting was unconstitutional. The decision could pave the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting, as several have already begun doing.

But the Murphy decision wasn’t the only one favorable to gambling interests last week. In another 5-4 ruling, this time in Carpenter v. United States, the court upheld a police search that had been conducted after officers noticed someone physically placing an antenna on top of a suspect’s car. Officers had been suspicious that the antenna was being used to help facilitate an illegal gambling operation, and they were later able to find evidence of betting slips and payments inside the car.

Kennedy sided with the majority in both cases, as did Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Stephen Breyer. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Brett Kavanaugh dissented in each instance.

So why did Kennedy vote in favor of gambling interests? Some have speculated that he may have felt pressure from those industries given his long history of support for them; Kennedy authored the landmark opinion in Citizens United v. FEC that legalized political spending by corporations and unions. Others argue that Kennedy’s rulings were simply consistent with his libertarian streak and his view that government should not interfere with individual freedoms unless there is a compelling reason to do so.

Regardless of motivation, the decisions last week are likely to be viewed as a major victory for gambling interests – and a significant loss for opponents who argue that such activities can lead to addiction and other social problems.

#  Justice with gambling ties wins big in court

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s brother, Martin, won a $2.7 million jackpot in Atlantic City this week.

The question on everyone’s mind is whether or not the justice’s impartiality can be called into question. The answer is no, according to court spokesperson Kathleen Arberg.

“Justice Ginsburg had no knowledge of her brother’s winnings,” Arberg told reporters.

Ginsburg herself was unavailable for comment.

This is not the first time the justice’s sibling has had a run-in with the law. Her brother was arrested twice for bookmaking in the 1970s.

Despite her family’s gambling ties, Ginsburg has been a staunch opponent of legalized gambling. She has written extensively on the subject, arguing that it leads to poverty and crime.

Many experts say that her personal views will have no bearing on how she rules in cases involving gambling interests.
