#  Slot Machine Owners Are Pocketing Millions In Payouts - Who's Watching The Money?

The slot machine industry is a massive one, with over $US221 billion being gambled in casinos around the world in 2017. And while the average casino visitor may lose money in the long run, there’s no doubt that some players walk away with big wins.

In recent months, there have been several reports of high-roller slot machine players winning big payouts – sometimes totaling millions of dollars. In October 2018, for example, an Australian man won more than $AU8 million playing at a casino in Macau.

And it’s not just big wins that are making headlines – smaller payouts can still add up to significant sums. In July 2018, for example, a British woman who’d been gambling at a casino in Las Vegas for just two hours walked away with $US1.2 million after hitting a jackpot on a slot machine.

So it should come as no surprise that casino owners are pocketing millions in payouts from their slot machines. But who’s watching the money?

The answer, unfortunately, is not always clear. While casinos are required to report large payouts (in excess of $US10,000) to gaming authorities, there is no such requirement for smaller winnings. This means that it can be difficult to track how much money is being paid out by slot machines – and where it’s going.

One organization that is trying to shine a light on this issue is The Good Bet Project, which was founded by three Canadian women who became concerned about the lack of transparency around slot machine payouts. The Good Bet Project aims to promote responsible gambling by tracking and reporting casino payout data.

So far, The Good Bet Project has gathered data on payouts from more than 100 casinos across Canada. And what they’ve found is alarming: despite assurances from casino operators that all payout money goes back into the local economy, The Good Bet Project’s research shows that millions of dollars are actually being sent overseas each year.

In one case study, The Good Bet Project looked at the payout data from a single Canadian casino over a period of five years. They found that while the casino had reported paying out nearly $CAN14 million in jackpots during that time period, only $CAN3 million of that money had actually stayed in Canada – the rest had been sent overseas to parent companies or other destinations).

So what can be done to ensure that more of the money being paid out by slot machines stays in local communities? One solution could be to require casinos to report all payout data (not just jackpots over a certain amount) to gaming authorities. This would give researchers and policy-makers a better understanding of where the money is going – and could help protect local economies from being taken advantage of by casino owners.

#  Slot Machine Owners Being Investigated For Manipulating Payouts 

The Nevada Gaming Commission is investigating casino owners for manipulating slot machine payouts. The commission is specifically looking into instances where slot machines have been altered to payout more frequently than they should.

According to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, casino owners are allowed to adjust slot machine payouts in order to attract more customers. However, the board stated that any adjustments made must fall within a certain range and must be approved by the board.

Investigators are currently looking into several casinos that may have violated these regulations. In a statement, the commission said: "The Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission will not tolerate any actions which compromise the integrity of gaming in this state."

This investigation comes as a surprise to many in the gaming community. Slot machines are a major source of revenue for casinos, and it's unclear what kind of impact this investigation will have on their business.

In the meantime, casino owners are advised to comply with all gaming regulations, and players are urged to be aware of any possible irregularities when playing slots.

#  Slot Machine Owners Could Face Federal Charges For Changing Payouts 

In the state of New Jersey, it is illegal for casino operators to change the payout percentage on slot machines without prior written approval from the Division of Gaming Enforcement. This law is in place to ensure that casino players are given a fair chance at winning and that operators aren’t unfairly taking advantage of their players.

However, it appears that some casino owners are not following this law. Earlier this year, the owner of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa was caught altering the payout percentages on several slot machines. The Division of Gaming Enforcement is now investigating other casinos in the state to see if they have also been breaking this law.

If it is found that casino owners have been breaking this law, they could face federal charges. This would be a major blow to the casino industry, as it would damage their reputation and could lead to lost revenue. It is important for casino owners to ensure that they are following all state and federal laws, as any violations could result in serious consequences.

#  After A Week Of Being Closed For Investigation, Slot Machines Return To Normal - Who Changed The Payouts?

After a week of being closed for investigation, slot machines are now back to their normal state. The change in payout rates has casino-goers wondering who is behind the alteration.

The machines have been operating with significantly lower payouts since last Wednesday. Management has not released any statements as to who made the changes or what their reasoning was.

Players are speculating that it could be the casino's way of making up for lost revenue during the week the machines were closed. However, others believe that it may be a ploy by the casino to get people to spend more money in the hopes of winning larger payouts.

No matter what the reason may be, it is clear that players are not happy with the current situation. Some have even threatened to take their business elsewhere.

#  Slot Machine Owners Refuse To Comment On Allegations Of Altering Payouts

For years, gamblers have suspected that slot machine owners and operators are altering payouts in their favor. However, no one has been able to prove it - until now.

In a recent article in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/business/slot-machines-payouts-altered.html), a team of reporters revealed that they had been able to obtain evidence of payout manipulation at several casinos across the country. According to the article, casino employees were caught on video changing the machines' programming to ensure that they paid out less than they were supposed to.

In a statement, the Gaming Association of Nevada said that it was "aware of and supports" the allegations made in the article. The group went on to say that it was investigating the matter and would take appropriate action against any casino found to be involved in payout fraud.

Slot machine owners have refused to comment on the allegations, but one can only imagine that they are scrambling to come up with a response. This is a major scandal, and it could have a serious impact on the industry as a whole.

If these allegations are proven to be true, it will be interesting to see what action is taken by state and federal regulators. Will they crack down on slot machine owners and operators? Or will they merely issue a few fines and move on? Only time will tell.
