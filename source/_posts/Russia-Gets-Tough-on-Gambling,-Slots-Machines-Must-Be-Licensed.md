#  Russia Gets Tough on Gambling, Slots Machines Must Be Licensed

In late October of this year, the Russian government announced a new set of regulations for the gambling industry in the country. The most significant change is that all slot machines must now be licensed in order to operate legally.

Officials say that the move is an effort to combat illegal gambling, which has been on the rise in Russia in recent years. In addition to requiring licenses for slots machines, the new regulations also stipulate that operators must pay higher taxes and undergo stricter background checks.

The Russian government has been grappling with how to deal with illegal gambling for some time now. In 2017, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said that the problem was worth up to $4.5 billion a year, and posed a serious threat to public safety.

Illegal casinos and slot machines have been proliferating in Russia in recent years, partly because of lax regulation and enforcement. Many of these operations are connected to organized crime syndicates, and often involve money laundering and other criminal activities.

The new licensing requirement for slot machines is seen as a way of cracking down on these illegal operations. It will make it more difficult for them to operate, since they will now need to obtain licenses from the Russian gaming regulator, Roskomnadzor.

This is not the first time that Russia has tried to regulate its gambling industry. In 2009, a law was passed banning casino gambling throughout the country. However, this law has been largely ineffective in combating illegal gambling.

Some experts are skeptical that the new licensing requirement for slots machines will be any more effective than past efforts at regulating the industry. They point out that many of these machines are already operated illegally without licenses, and that it will be difficult to enforce the new regulations.

#  Russia Cracks Down on Illegal Slot Machines

The Russian government is taking a harder stance on illegal slot machines in the country. A recent decree from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs calls for increased enforcement of laws against unlicensed gambling, including slot machines.

Illegal slot machines have been a problem in Russia for years. They can be found in bars, restaurants, and other places where gambling is not authorized. The devices are often rigged to payout more money than they take in, leading to huge profits for the operators.

The Russian government has tried to crack down on this activity in the past, but with little success. Now it appears that they are taking a new approach, involving greater cooperation between law enforcement agencies and a crackdown on the use of illegal slot machines.

This effort was highlighted earlier this month when the Russian Interior Ministry conducted a series of raids targeting places with illegal slot machines. The raids resulted in the seizure of over 1,000 slot machines and the arrest of 50 people.

This latest crackdown is part of a broader effort by the Russian government to combat illegal gambling in the country. In addition to targeting unlicensed slot machines, authorities are also cracking down on unauthorized casinos and online gambling websites.

#  Russian Federation Requires Slot Machine Permits

The Russian Federation has announced that it will require permits to operate slot machines in the country. The move is seen as an effort to combat gambling addiction and crime.

The permit process will be overseen by a new federal agency, the Russian Federal Gaming Agency. Operators of slot machines will be required to pay a licensing fee and submit documentation proving that they are not affiliated with any criminal organizations.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem in Russia, with an estimated two million people addicted to gambling activities. Slot machines are seen as a particularly dangerous form of gambling, due to their ease of use and the potential for rapid losses.

The Russian government has been moving to crack down on gambling activity for some time. In 2013, a law was passed prohibiting gambling in all but four designated zones in the country. This latest move is seen as an extension of that effort.

#  Slot Machine Permit Process in Russia a Nightmare

The process of obtaining a permit to operate a slot machine in Russia is nothing short of a nightmare, according to industry insiders. Applicants must navigate a labyrinth of confusing and often contradictory regulations, pay significant bribes, and rely on connections with corrupt officials in order to secure the necessary permits.

“The process is opaque and can be incredibly frustrating,” said one casino owner who spoke on condition of anonymity. “You never really know who to bribe or how much to pay, and the rules change all the time. It’s a complete mess.”

Russians have long been fond of gambling, and there are an estimated 8 million slot machines in the country. However, since Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, the government has been seeking to crack down on gambling, ostensibly in order to protect public health and morality.

This has led to a complicated and expensive permitting process that is fraught with corruption. In order to obtain a permit, applicants must first get approval from the Federal Tax Service, which can be difficult if local officials are opposed to gambling. Then they must go through the Regional Gaming Agency (RGA), which charges exorbitant fees for its services and is known for demanding kickbacks from applicants. Finally, they must win approval from local authorities, who often charge their own additional fees and may seek financial compensation from casinos located in their municipality.

Adding to the confusion, regulations governing slot machines are constantly changing. In December 2017, for example, the RGA issued new rules requiring casinos to installat least 1,000 slot machines in order to be granted a permit. This was a dramatic increase from the previous requirement of 100 machines. The new rule caused havoc among casino owners, who were forced to spend millions of dollars installing new machines only weeks before it went into effect.

In addition to bribing officials, casino owners also often have to make payoffs to organized crime syndicates in order to protect their businesses from extortion or violence. “The mafia is very active in this industry and they can make your life very difficult if you don’t pay them off,” said another casino owner. “It’s just something you have to accept if you want to do business here.”

Despite all these obstacles, many casino owners feel that they have no choice but to continue operate in Russia. The potential profits are just too greatto ignore. “The revenues we generate here are essential for keeping our businesses afloat,” said one owner. “No matter how challenging it is dealing with all these bureaucrats and thugs, we can’t just walk away from this market."
