#  Cleveland Browns crush San Diego Chargers, now offer big payouts to those who bet on them!

When the Cleveland Browns take on the San Diego Chargers last weekend, many people were betting on the Chargers to win. The Browns, however, had other plans.

Led by backup quarterback Josh McCown, the Browns crushed the Chargers 33-14. This not only means a big upset for those who bet on the Chargers, but also means some major payouts for those who placed bets on the Browns.

The Browns managed to score two touchdowns in the first quarter alone and never looked back. McCown went 18 for 34 for a total of no touchdowns and one interception. He wasn’t even the star of the game – that title goes to Isaiah Crowell, who rushed for 195 yards and two touchdowns.

 San Diego’s Philip Rivers had a terrible game, throwing interceptions on three consecutive drives in the second half.

This win is a major morale boost for the Browns, who have been struggling in recent years. With this victory under their belt, they can now look forward to trying to make it to the playoffs next season.

For those of you who bet on them – congratulations! You just made some serious profits.

#  How to calculate your winnings on a Cleveland Browns bet (includes detailed examples!)

The Cleveland Browns have had an interesting season this year. Going into their final game, they are 7-8 and still have a chance to make the playoffs. If you’ve placed bets on them at any point this season, you’re probably wondering how much money you could potentially win.

In this article, we’re going to walk you through how to calculate your potential winnings on a Browns bet. We’ll show you how to do it with two different types of bets: Against the spread (ATS) and straight up (SU).

Before getting started, let’s take a quick look at the odds for Cleveland’s final game against the Baltimore Ravens. As of this writing, Bovada has set the spread at +3 for the Ravens and -3 for the Browns. This means that if you take the Ravens, they have to win by 4 or more points for you to win your bet. If you take the Browns, they can lose by up to 3 points and you would still win your bet.

Now that we know the spread, let’s start calculating our potential winnings!

Calculating Your Winnings Against The Spread (ATS)

When betting against the spread, there are three possible outcomes: You could win, lose, or push. Let’s take a look at each:

If you win , your wager amount will be multiplied by the number of points your team won by . So if you wagered $10 on the Browns and they won by 4 points, your total winnings would be $40 ( $10 x 4 = $40).

If you lose , your bet is simply lost . There is no refund or adjustment whatsoever.

If there is a push , your bet is refunded in its entirety . This happens when there is exactly a 3-point difference in score between both teams - for example, if Baltimore wins by 2 points then it would be considered a push.























 * For illustration purposes only - please consult with an actual bookmaker for updated odds      So now that we know how to calculate our potential ATS winnings, let’s take a look at an example using real world numbers. Say you placed a $10 bet on Cleveland ATS and they ended up losing by 2 points. In this scenario, your bet would be considered a push and you would get your $10 back in full.   That was easy enough - now let’s move on to calculating our potential SU winnings! Calculating Your Winnings Straight Up (SU) When betting straight up on a team, there are only two possible outcomes: You could win or lose . Let’s take a look at each: If you win , your wager amount will be multiplied by the number of points your team won by . So if you wagered $10 on the Browns and they won by 10 points, your total winnings would be $100 ( $10 x 10 = $100).  If y ou lose , your bet is simply lost . There is no refund or adjustment whatsoever. Just like with ATS bets, it's important to note that pushes don't exist when betting SU - if there's a tie then it's just as though neither team won/lost. Let's go over one last example before moving on to our final tips & tricks section. Say you wagered $10 on Cleveland SU and they ended up losing by 5 points. In this scenario, your bet would be considered a loss and you would forfeit all of your invested money. Simple enough! Tips & Tricks Now that we've gone over how to calculate our potential Browns betting windfalls, here are some final tips & tricks to help boost your chances of winning: 1.) ALWAYS research matchup statistics before placing any bets . This includes looking not just at which team is favored to win but also considering things like individual player stats and home/away records. All of this information can help give you a better idea about how likely each outcome is - which can help inform which bets are most advantageous for you to make. 2.) Use multiple bookmakers when possible . This way you can compare odds and find the best bang for your buck. Remember that not all bookmakers offer NFL lines so it's important do some digging before deciding who to place money with. 3.) Consider hedging bets whenever possible . This tactic can help minimize losses in case of an unfavorable outcome while still maintaining some exposure to potential wins. For example, say you think Cleveland has around an 75% chance of winning their next game but also realize that Bovada's odds currently have them as +240 underdog wolves dog toys toy story woody woodpecker pecker WIN ). By placing a smaller wager ($5 for example) on Cleveland SU
