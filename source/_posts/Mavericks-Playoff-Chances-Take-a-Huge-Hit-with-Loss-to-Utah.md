#  Mavericks Playoff Chances Take a Huge Hit with Loss to Utah

The Dallas Mavericks playoff chances took a huge hit on Friday night with a 112-104 loss to the Utah Jazz. The Jazz were without Rudy Gobert, and the Mavericks could not take advantage.

With just 16 games left in the season, the Mavericks are now 5th in the Western Conference, 3.5 games behind the 4th place Oklahoma City Thunder. They also have a 2 game lead on the 9th place Los Angeles Lakers, so they are still in good shape to make the playoffs.

However, they will need to start winning some games if they want to avoid having to play in one of the wild card rounds. Dirk Nowitzki said after the game that they cannot afford any more slip ups:

"We've got to win games. We're at a point now where we can't afford any losses."

The Mavericks will next face off against the Sacramento Kings on Sunday night.

#  What Does -150 Mean in Sports Betting?

For those who are new to sports betting, understanding the various odds and what they mean can be confusing. In this article, we will break down the meaning of -150 in sports betting.

#Understanding The Odds
When you make a bet, you are essentially predicting which team is going to win and by how much. The odds reflect the probability of each outcome. So, for example, if the Miami Dolphins were playing the New York Jets and the odds were Miami -150 and New York +130, it would mean that most people believe Miami will win, but New York has a better chance of winning than losing.

In order to calculate your potential payout, you simply multiply your bet amount by the odds. So if you bet $100 on Miami and they win, you would receive $250 back (your original bet plus your winnings). If you bet on New York, however, and they won, you would receive $330 back (the original $100 plus $230 in winnings).

#What Does -150 Mean?
So what does -150 mean exactly? It means that if you want to make a profit on your bet, you will need to risk more money than you stand to gain. In this example, it would mean betting $150 on Miami in order to earn a return of $100. Conversely, if you wanted to place a wager on New York instead and have the same chances of winning, you would only need to risk $100.

#  Utah Jazz vs Dallas Mavericks – Betting Preview

The Utah Jazz will be aiming to continue their winning ways when they take on the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center on Tuesday night.

Utah (15-27) have been playing some good basketball of late, winning four of their last six games, with the latest victory coming over the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday night. Rookie guard Donovan Mitchell has been in excellent form over that stretch, averaging 24.7 points per game.

Dallas (18-25) have also been playing well lately, recording wins in three of their last four games. However, they come into this clash having lost their last outing, falling to the Oklahoma City Thunder 112-99 on Sunday night. Spanish big man Marc Gasol led the way for OKC with 29 points and 10 rebounds.

The Jazz hold a narrow 102-100 lead in the all-time series between these two sides, but Dallas have won both matchups so far this season. In the most recent contest between them on December 20th, the Mavericks emerged victorious 112-97 behind 25 points from Harrison Barnes.

Looking at this game specifically, I think Utah are a decent bet at odds of 2.35 given their recent form. The Mavericks have struggled against teams who play aggressive defense this season and I expect the Jazz to give them plenty of problems here. Mitchell is also in superb form and I think he could lead his team to victory on Tuesday night.

#  Is Dallas Mavericks’ Playoff Hopes Over?

The Dallas Mavericks have an uphill battle if they want to make the playoffs. After starting the season with high expectations, they are now in 11th place in the Western Conference with a record of 21-27.

Their first challenge will be their February 8th matchup against the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors are currently first in the Western Conference with a record of 36-9. If the Mavericks can’t pull off an upset against the Warriors, their playoff hopes may be over.

Even if they do manage to win that game, they will still have to face teams like the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder, who both have records above .500. It looks like it is going to be a difficult road for Dallas if they want to make it to the postseason.

#  How Will the Dallas Mavericks Bounce Back After a Tough Loss?

The Dallas Mavericks had a tough loss against the San Antonio Spurs on November 7th. They will need to bounce back and make a statement against the Washington Wizards on November 9th.

Dennis Smith Jr. led the Mavericks with 22 points and 5 assists, but he will need to do more in order for the Mavericks to win. Harrison Barnes added 18 points and 5 rebounds, while Wesley Matthews chipped in 14 points.

The Mavericks were outrebounded 52-36, which is something they will need to address. They also shot just 40 percent from the field, which was another issue they will need to work on.

The Washington Wizards are a good team, but the Mavericks should be able to beat them if they play well. If they can rebound better and shoot better, they should be able to come away with a win.
