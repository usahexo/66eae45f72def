The Browns, however, had other plans.</p>
<p>Led by backup quarterback Josh McCown, the Browns crushed the Chargers 33-14. This not only means a big upset for those who bet on the Chargers, but also means some major payouts for those who placed bets on the Browns.</p>
<p>The Browns managed to score two touchdowns in the first quarter alone and never looked back. McCown went 18 for 34 for a total of no touchdowns and one interception. He wasn’t even the star of the game – that title goes to Isaiah Crowell, who rushed for 195 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p> San Diego’s Philip Rivers had a terrible game, throwing interceptions on three consecutive drives in the second half.</p>
<p>This win is a major morale boost for the Browns, who have been struggling in recent years. With this victory under their belt, they can now look forward to trying to make it to the playoffs next season.</p>
<p>For those of you who bet on them – congratulations! You just made some serious profits.</p>
<h1 id="Cleveland-Browns-shock-the-experts-cover-7-spread-against-San-Diego-Chargers"><a href="#Cleveland-Browns-shock-the-experts-cover-7-spread-against-San-Diego-Chargers" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland Browns shock the experts, cover +7 spread against San Diego Chargers!"></a>Cleveland Browns shock the experts, cover +7 spread against San Diego Chargers!</h1><p>It was a close game, but in the end the Cleveland Browns pulled off the upset win against the San Diego Chargers. The final score was 20-17, and the Browns managed to cover the +7 spread.</p>
<p>Many experts had picked the Chargers to win easily, but the Browns came out fighting and took an early lead. The Chargers staged a comeback in the second half, but it wasn’t enough to take down Cleveland.</p>
<p>This was a major victory for the Browns, who have been struggling in recent years. It’s clear that they have turned a corner and are starting to become a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.</p>
<p>The fans in Cleveland are absolutely ecstatic about this win, and they are hoping that it is a sign of things to come. If the Browns can play like this every week, they could very well make the playoffs this season.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if they can keep up this level of play, but there is no doubt that they have exceeded everyone’s expectations so far.</p>
<h1 id="Huge-winnings-await-those-who-correctly-predicted-Cleveland-Browns-upset-victory-over-Chargers"><a href="#Huge-winnings-await-those-who-correctly-predicted-Cleveland-Browns-upset-victory-over-Chargers" class="headerlink" title="Huge winnings await those who correctly predicted Cleveland Browns upset victory over Chargers!"></a>Huge winnings await those who correctly predicted Cleveland Browns upset victory over Chargers!</h1><p>For those who wagered on the Cleveland Browns to upset the Los Angeles Chargers last week, congratulations are in order! Your correct prediction netted you some significant winnings.</p>
<p>Punters around the globe were confident in the Browns’ ability to pull off the upset and many of them placed bets accordingly. The odds for such an upset were astronomical, but that didn’t stop people from betting on it.</p>
<p>In the end, the Browns managed to win 38-14, which was a complete shock to everyone. This was easily their most impressive performance of the season and it came against a team that was considered to be one of the strongest in the league.</p>
<p>If you had wagered on this game, then you would have walked away with a lot of money. In fact, some people reportedly won over $100,000 by betting on Cleveland. So if you didn’t place a bet on this game, then you may have missed out on some big rewards.</p>
<p>The Browns will now look to build on this victory as they continue their push for a playoff spot. They currently sit at 5-7-1 and are just two games back from the final Wild Card spot. If they can manage to win their remaining games, then they will certainly qualify for the postseason.</p>
<p>This recent victory over San Diego has given Cleveland fans hope that their team can do something special this year. And with players like Baker Mayfield and Myles Garrett leading the charge, anything is possible!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-calculate-your-winnings-on-a-Cleveland-Browns-bet-includes-detailed-examples"><a href="#How-to-calculate-your-winnings-on-a-Cleveland-Browns-bet-includes-detailed-examples" class="headerlink" title="How to calculate your winnings on a Cleveland Browns bet (includes detailed examples!)"></a>How to calculate your winnings on a Cleveland Browns bet (includes detailed examples!)</h1><p>The Cleveland Browns have had an interesting season this year. Going into their final game, they are 7-8 and still have a chance to make the playoffs. If you’ve placed bets on them at any point this season, you’re probably wondering how much money you could potentially win.</p>
<p>In this article, we’re going to walk you through how to calculate your potential winnings on a Browns bet. We’ll show you how to do it with two different types of bets: Against the spread (ATS) and straight up (SU).</p>
<p>Before getting started, let’s take a quick look at the odds for Cleveland’s final game against the Baltimore Ravens. As of this writing, Bovada has set the spread at +3 for the Ravens and -3 for the Browns. This means that if you take the Ravens, they have to win by 4 or more points for you to win your bet. If you take the Browns, they can lose by up to 3 points and you would still win your bet.</p>
<p>Now that we know the spread, let’s start calculating our potential winnings!</p>
<p>Calculating Your Winnings Against The Spread (ATS)</p>
<p>When betting against the spread, there are three possible outcomes: You could win, lose, or push. Let’s take a look at each:</p>
<p>If you win , your wager amount will be multiplied by the number of points your team won by . So if you wagered $10 on the Browns and they won by 4 points, your total winnings would be $40 ( $10 x 4 &#x3D; $40).</p>
<p>If you lose , your bet is simply lost . There is no refund or adjustment whatsoever.</p>
<p>If there is a push , your bet is refunded in its entirety . This happens when there is exactly a 3-point difference in score between both teams - for example, if Baltimore wins by 2 points then it would be considered a push.</p>
<ul>
<li>For illustration purposes only - please consult with an actual bookmaker for updated odds      So now that we know how to calculate our potential ATS winnings, let’s take a look at an example using real world numbers. Say you placed a $10 bet on Cleveland ATS and they ended up losing by 2 points. In this scenario, your bet would be considered a push and you would get your $10 back in full.   That was easy enough - now let’s move on to calculating our potential SU winnings! Calculating Your Winnings Straight Up (SU) When betting straight up on a team, there are only two possible outcomes: You could win or lose . Let’s take a look at each: If you win , your wager amount will be multiplied by the number of points your team won by . So if you wagered $10 on the Browns and they won by 10 points, your total winnings would be $100 ( $10 x 10 &#x3D; $100).  If y ou lose , your bet is simply lost . There is no refund or adjustment whatsoever. Just like with ATS bets, it’s important to note that pushes don’t exist when betting SU - if there’s a tie then it’s just as though neither team won&#x2F;lost. Let’s go over one last example before moving on to our final tips &amp; tricks section. Say you wagered $10 on Cleveland SU and they ended up losing by 5 points. In this scenario, your bet would be considered a loss and you would forfeit all of your invested money. Simple enough! Tips &amp; Tricks Now that we’ve gone over how to calculate our potential Browns betting windfalls, here are some final tips &amp; tricks to help boost your chances of winning: 1.) ALWAYS research matchup statistics before placing any bets . This includes looking not just at which team is favored to win but also considering things like individual player stats and home&#x2F;away records. All of this information can help give you a better idea about how likely each outcome is - which can help inform which bets are most advantageous for you to make. 2.) Use multiple bookmakers when possible . This way you can compare odds and find the best bang for your buck. Remember that not all bookmakers offer NFL lines so it’s important do some digging before deciding who to place money with. 3.) Consider hedging bets whenever possible . This tactic can help minimize losses in case of an unfavorable outcome while still maintaining some exposure to potential wins. For example, say you think Cleveland has around an 75% chance of winning their next game but also realize that Bovada’s odds currently have them as +240 underdog wolves dog toys toy story woody woodpecker pecker WIN ). By placing a smaller wager ($5 for example) on Cleveland SU</li>
