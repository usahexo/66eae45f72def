        <h1 id="Atlantic-City-legalizes-casino-gambling-in-1978"><a href="#Atlantic-City-legalizes-casino-gambling-in-1978" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City legalizes casino gambling in 1978"></a>Atlantic City legalizes casino gambling in 1978</h1><p>On July 2, 1978, Atlantic City became the first city in the United States to legalize casino gambling. The vote came after a referendum in 1976 showed that a majority of Atlantic City residents were in favor of it.</p>
<p>Casino gambling was seen as a way to revive the city’s fortunes, which had been declining since the early 1970s. In its first year of operation, casino gambling brought in over $100 million in revenue.</p>
<p>The legalization of casino gambling also led to a building boom in Atlantic City. Hotels, restaurants, and other businesses sprang up to cater to casino tourists. The city’s skyline changed with the addition of new high-rise hotels and casinos.</p>
<p>Over the years, casino gambling has brought billions of dollars into Atlantic City’s economy. However, the city has also suffered from the effects of casino gambling. Problems such as crime and addiction have taken their toll on the city.</p>
<p>Despite these problems, casino gambling remains an important part of Atlantic City’s economy. It is responsible for thousands of jobs and generates millions of dollars in tax revenue each year.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City’s-casino-gambling-industry-thrives-for-over-three-decades"><a href="#Atlantic-City’s-casino-gambling-industry-thrives-for-over-three-decades" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City’s casino gambling industry thrives for over three decades"></a>Atlantic City’s casino gambling industry thrives for over three decades</h1><p>Atlantic City, NJ is well known for its casino gambling industry. The city’s casinos have been a major tourist attraction and driver of the local economy for over three decades.</p>
<p>The city’s casino gambling industry first took off in the early 1980s. At that time, there were only a few casinos in the city and they were relatively small. However, the industry grew rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s as new casinos were built and the existing ones were expanded.</p>
<p>The Atlantic City gaming industry reached its peak in 2006, when it generated over $5 billion in gaming revenue. However, the Great Recession of 2008 took a toll on the industry and gaming revenue declined sharply from 2007 to 2009.</p>
<p>The industry has since recovered and regained much of its lost ground. In 2017, Atlantic City’s casinos generated over $3 billion in gaming revenue. This was still below the peak level of 2006, but it represented a significant increase from 2009 levels.</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s casino industry is currently facing some challenges. The competition from other states with legalized casino gambling is one factor that is putting pressure on the industry. Additionally, there has been growing concern about the detrimental effects of casino gambling on social and economic welfare. This has led to efforts to restrict or ban casino gambling in some jurisdictions.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City’s-casino-gambling-industry-begins-to-decline-in-the-early-21st-century"><a href="#Atlantic-City’s-casino-gambling-industry-begins-to-decline-in-the-early-21st-century" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City’s casino gambling industry begins to decline in the early 21st century"></a>Atlantic City’s casino gambling industry begins to decline in the early 21st century</h1><p>Atlantic City’s casino gambling industry begins to decline in the early 21st century as neighboring states begin to legalize gambling. This leads to a decrease in tourism and revenue for the city.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-repeals-casino-gambling-in-2014"><a href="#Atlantic-City-repeals-casino-gambling-in-2014" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City repeals casino gambling in 2014"></a>Atlantic City repeals casino gambling in 2014</h1><p>On October 10, 2014, Atlantic City’s referendum to repeal casino gambling passed with over 60% of the vote. This referendum was placed on the ballot by a citizen-sponsored petition that gained the required number of signatures in just six weeks. The Atlantic City Alliance, which is the city’s marketing arm, was opposed to the repeal and estimated that it would cost the city over 1,000 jobs and $200 million in annual economic activity.</p>
<p>Supporters of the repeal argued that casino gambling had not lived up to its promises, including creating jobs and jumpstarting economic growth. They also pointed to rising crime rates and increasing levels of poverty as evidence that casino gambling was not benefitting the city as hoped. Some opponents of repeal also pointed out that much of the revenue generated by casinos was being funneled out of state due to a lack of regulation and oversight.</p>
<p>The referendum’s passage means that casino gambling will be repealed in Atlantic City as of December 31, 2014. Casinos will still be able to operate in Atlantic City until that date, but they will not be able to take any new bets or offer new games.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City’s-casino-gaming-industry-rebounds-after-repeal-of-gambling-in-2014"><a href="#Atlantic-City’s-casino-gaming-industry-rebounds-after-repeal-of-gambling-in-2014" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City’s casino gaming industry rebounds after repeal of gambling in 2014"></a>Atlantic City’s casino gaming industry rebounds after repeal of gambling in 2014</h1><p>Atlantic City’s casino gaming industry has rebounded since the repeal of gambling in 2014. According to recent reports, casino gaming revenue reached $2.48 billion in 2017, up from $2.06 billion in 2014.</p>
<p>The rebound is largely due to an increase in visitation to Atlantic City. In 2017, approximately 33 million people visited Atlantic City’s casinos, up from 27 million in 2014. This increase in visitation is attributable to several factors, including the addition of new casinos and resorts in Atlantic City, as well as the legalization of gambling in other states.</p>
<p>In spite of the rebound, there are some concerns about the future of Atlantic City’s casino gaming industry. The increasing popularity of online gambling may cause a decline in visitation to Atlantic City’s casinos in the future. In addition, competition from other states may lead to a decrease in revenue for Atlantic City’s casinos.</p>
